A complicated programme may require hundreds of separate files containing source code, method definitions, classes, and other information that make up all of the code needed to operate the programme. This code is referred to as the application's environment. In general, we keep all the code required to set up the atmosphere in config/. This might be found in a config/environment.rb file or the complete config/environments/ directory.
