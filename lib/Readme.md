Most of our code is stored in the lib/ or Library directory in typical Ruby programmes and the app/ directory in Rails projects or larger Ruby systems. All of the files that specify what our software can accomplish are contained in this directory. The files in this directory contain all of the methods and classes that our software requires. One file may specify a set of plans for a song by an artist, while another may define a set of methods for searching for a piece by genre. These methods could be combined to create a Music Search application. This directory is where we spend the majority of our time writing code.
