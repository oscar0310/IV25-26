Tests are written by great developers for their code. It's critical to be able to develop tests that ensure your code operates as expected, whether you use Test-Driven Development or not. It's also essential to be able to read and comprehend tests and the criteria they specify for your code. All of our tests are saved in the test/ or spec/ folders (depends of the test tool used)
